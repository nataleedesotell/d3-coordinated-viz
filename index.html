			<div id = "bigpicture"><h2>Why does this matter?</h2>When you think about what constitutes a "rural" area, you might picture wide open fields and winding country roads. However, when it comes to making important policy or budgeting decisions, the distinction between urban and rural has to be more calculated. Several organizations have devised their own measures of rurality, each with varying implications and applications. <br><br>This interactive of county-based systems was created to illustrate how differently rurality can be defined and how important it is to choose a system wisely. There are also several systems at the census tract and ZIP code levels; eventually, this map will extend to include several of those levels as well. </div>
			<div id = "description"><h2>What are all these measures?</h2><b>Rural-Urban Continuum Codes </b><br>RUC Codes distinguish metropolitan counties by the <br>population size of their metro area, identifying <br>nonmetropolitan counties by degree of urbanization <br>and adjacency to a metro area.<br><br><b>NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme</b><br>Developed by the National Center for Health Statistics,<br> this scheme has more metropolitan than nonmetropolitan levels <br>because the metropolitan population can support more levels <br> for health analyses.<br><br><b>Urban Influence Codes</b><br>The UICs identify metropolitan counties by the population size of their metro area, and nonmetropolitan counties by size of the largest city and proximity to metro and micropolitan areas.<br><br><b>Index of Relative Rurality</b><br>The IRR is based on population, the population density, extent of urbanized area, and distance to the nearest metro area. <br><br><b>National Center for Frontier Communities</b><br>This scheme simply distinguishes frontier counties from non-frontier counties. Frontier areas are defined as geographically isolated areas, often sparsely populated with long travel times to community services. </div>
